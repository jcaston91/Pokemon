# Pokemon

For this project I will be looking at the Pokémon data. There are 718 different Pokémon in this dataset, and all of them carry their stats with them. Along with the stats the Pokémon also display what type of Pokémon they are. I think it would be great to show the total amount of each different type of Pokémon. From there we can see what Pokémon is the strongest in each type is judging from all different stat areas. WE can then also see what Pokémon type is the strongest of them all.

In this dataset I wanted to play around and have fun with something that I loved in my childhood, which is why I chose to look at this cool pokemon data that I found. I liked this data because I got to practice working with some categorical data. This gave me the perfect chance to practice with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). I also worked a little with logistic regression and looked at K- nearest neighbor (KNN).

I encourage all to take a look at this dataset and see what kind of fun you can have.
